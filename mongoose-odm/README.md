From Udemy [The Complete 2020 Webdev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101qYwBEIcc1ZVTXg=/) by Angela Yu.

## Description

A demonstration of find/insert/delete with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and a local Mongo Server.

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

## Workflow

1. Connect to the `Food` database.
1. Delete data from the `fruit` collection and log results to console.
1. Insert data into the `fruit` collection and log results to console.
1. Find data in the `fruit` collection and log results to console.
